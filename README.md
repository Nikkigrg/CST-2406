CST 2406: Project 1
The company that I have decided to choose is Costco. Costco is an American membership-only large warehouse club that provides a wide variety of merchandise. Costco is the second largest retailer in the United States after Wal-Mart.


Costco has been very popular with the baby boomers and I have first hand witness the type of members Costco attracts. As baby boomers retire, they won’t be the main driver of American consumption which will have a direct impact on Costco. The millennial generation which equates to 25% of America’s population will soon be the main driver of American consumption. By implementing the information system, it allows the company to gauge firstly age group the company is attracting. Secondly, accordingly, Costco can make amendments although ensuring that the changes aren’t so drastic that it will hamper its present clients.
